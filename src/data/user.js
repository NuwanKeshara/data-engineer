			"Hi, I‚Äôm a Data Engineer who‚Äôs genuinely passionate about all things about data üíª. I love diving deep into how big data systems are built and how they scale. Right now, I‚Äôm reading about Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann üìñ. If you‚Äôve read it (or have some great data books to recommend), please reach out I can happily chat about data for hours ü§ì. Outside of data, I‚Äôm big into sports and the outdoors üåç. I‚Äôve competed (and even won üèÜ) in swimming üèä, enjoy long cycling rides üö¥ and love exploring nature üå≤. It really keeps me energized and inspired. ",
